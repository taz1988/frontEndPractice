# Introduction
This is a sample dummy project, to practice front-end task runners (I call them development pipelines :)).

# Background story (for some advanture)
You are Joe and this is your second day in a small tech company. You are just a junior, but all other dev lead the company, so your job is to ship the software to the client. The client requirement is that all CSS and JS file should be put into one file. Since your previous coworkers were too lazy, nobody implement any task runner which do this job (and also do other optimalization too).

# Structure of subdirectories
* **starterProject** This contains the starter project, what has no any pipeline.
* **grunt** The starter project with grunt task runner
